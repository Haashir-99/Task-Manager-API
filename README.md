The Task Manager API is a robust and scalable RESTful API designed to facilitate task management in a collaborative environment.
It allows users to register, authenticate, and manage tasks efficiently, with support for role-based access control through a dynamic
team system. Users can create and join teams, assign tasks, and manage roles within their teams, ensuring that tasks are organized 
and tracked effectively. The API provides endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks, user management, and team interactions


[ - ]----[ Authorization ]----[ - ]

The Task Manager API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and authorization.
So a token is provided on Login which needs to be set as a header for authorization to work.
